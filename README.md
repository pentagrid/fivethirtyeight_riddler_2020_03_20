# fivethirtyeight_riddler_2020_03_20
This is a solution to the March 20th 2020 FiveThirtyEight Riddler Express question, which asks how many days into a sale where a price is lowered by 10% in the morning and then raised by 10% in the evening will management discover it has fallen by over 50% in the evening. The solution was fairly easy to solve analytically, but simulations are always fun. This is provided as riddler_sales.py

There is also a solution to the full riddler as well, on the topic of the game Set, answering question 1 and 3. Question 1 asks for the largest amount of drawn cards that do not have a Set in them. Question 3 is on the probability that groups of 12 cards do not have a Set. This is provided as riddler_set.py.
