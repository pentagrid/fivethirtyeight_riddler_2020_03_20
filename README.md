This is a solution to the March 20th 2020 FiveThirtyEight Riddler Express question, which asks how many days into a sale where a price is lowered by 10% in the morning and then raised by 10% in the evening will management discover it has fallen by over 50% in the evening. The solution was fairly easy to solve analytically, but simulations are always fun.
